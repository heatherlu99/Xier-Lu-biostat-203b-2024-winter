### Overall Grade: 184/300

### Late penalty

Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? Take 10 pts off per day for late submission.

### Quality of report: 30/50

**No html submitted.**

Is the report clear (sectioning, whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how results are produced by just reading the report? Take points off if the report is too succinct to grasp, or there are too many typos/grammar.

### Reproducibility: 20/50

**Could not reproduce qmd for final html**

### Completeness and performance: 80/100

Completeness (50): 3 machine learning algorithms (each with CV tuning) + model stacking. Clearly present the results with a few sentences of interpretation.

Performance (50): Score will be mainly determined by the distribution of the reported best AUCs in the class.

If the report is not reproducible at all, the score of this section will be 0.

**No discussion of interpretability or comparison of performance among models. No discussion of variable importance for all models.**

### Usage of Git: 30/50

**Still: wrong repository name, no use of develop branch**

**Final version was not pushed to Github**

-   Are branches (`main` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `main` branch?

-   Are there enough commits (\>=5) in develop branch? Are commit messages clear? The commits should span out not clustered the day before deadline.

-   Is the hw submission tagged?

-   Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly?

-   Do not put auxiliary files into version control.

### R code style: 24/50

**59, 61, 93, 94, 192, 193, 274, 275 long line\
93, 192, 274 indent\
93, 118 comma spacing**

For bash commands, only enforce the 80-character rule. Take 2 pts off for each violation.

-   [Rule 2.5](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#long-lines) The maximum line length is 80 characters. Long URLs and strings are exceptions.

-   [Rule 2.4.1](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#indenting) When indenting your code, use two spaces.

-   [Rule 2.2.4](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#infix-operators) Place spaces around all infix operators (=, +, -, \<-, etc.).\

-   [Rule 2.2.1.](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#commas) Do not place a space before a comma, but always place one after a comma.

-   [Rule 2.2.2](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#parentheses) Do not place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets. Place a space before left parenthesis, except in a function call.
